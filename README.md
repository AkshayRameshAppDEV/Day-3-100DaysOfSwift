# Day 3

## Learnt the following:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
  - Common Operators are supported in swift +, -, *, /, %(modulo) reminder operator.
  - Divide by zero is exception
  - Apples to apples for types in operands between binary operators

### 2. Operator Overloading
  - "+" for addition, joining strings, joining array
  - Use only if it makes sense

### 3. Compound Operators 
  - Shorthand notations +=, -=, *=, /= --> Do the operation and assign the value

### 4. Comparison Operators 
  - <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
  - When comparing strings.. they follow natural alphabetical order
  - Also compares enum because they are represented in numerical order
  
### 5. Conditions
  - If, else if, else
  - Conditional operators && (both operands should be true), || (Only one of the operands to be true)
  
### 6. Ternary Operator 
  - `x != y ? "x is awesome" : "y is awesome"`

### 7. Switch Case 
  - Switch case based on condition or default case
  - There can be `fallthrough` case, which will perform the case where it hits first and then executes the next possible case.
  - There can be multiple `fallthrough` cases

### 8. Range Case 
  - `left..<right` left to right excluding
  - `left...right` left to right including
  - **NOTE**: in array [1...] will give all the elements from index 1 to end of array
